**!!! Work-in-Progress Draft !!!**

The Order Of The C Chatroom
===========================

Rules
-----

0.  The purpose of this room is to help each other learning, understanding and
    using the C programming language and all its related theories and
    technologies (compilers, preprocessors, make, UNIX, versioning, etc).

    >   That doesn't mean we restrict ourselves to talk about C only. We are
        also discussing our projects and sometimes even our problems in life as
        well since we are building a real community here. But, the main topic
        still remains C. Because other languages have their own chat-rooms, if
        you are interested in those other languages' features, know-hows or any
        other discussions about them, please join the designed rooms instead.

1.  Be nice!

    >-  This is a very friendly, open and helpful room. And we are working very
        hard to keep it that way, and so should you. We are all here to help
        each other, to start meaningful and constructive conversations and to
        achieve the goal of this room. (*[See the first rule!](#rules)*)

     >-  Feel free to ping whenever it helps to smoothen the conversation. Don't
        overdo it though as it can get annoying.

     >-  You don't need to ask if it's okay to ask a question in the room.

2.  No trolling! (And no feeding!)

    >   What is trolling? An endless and purposeless debate which is being
        instigated again and again by the same debater, the troll.

3.  C stands for...

    >   Code, Control, Community, Complexity, Creativity, Craziness... -- you
        get the point ;)



Guidelines
----------

Please read the [chatroom FAQ](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/faq) if you haven't already

0.  Use our *chat-lang*, because it's fun!

    >   We have a [tiny language](http://bit.ly/c_chat) we use to greet
        each other, to say 'good bye', to indicate we are currently not
        available or that we have returned. *And of course, it is C related ;)*

1.  You don't have to ask to ask, just ask.

    >   We are here to help, although it is not guaranteed that we can, however
        we will definitely try to! (*[See the first rule!](#rules)*)

2.  When asking, try to help us, to help you!

    >   Have you ever heard of the concept of SSCCE (Short, Self Contained,
        Compilable, Example)?
        [If not, you definitely have to check it out!](http://sscce.org)

3.  Format your code!

    >   Try to follow one of the
        [code-styling conventions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style)
        (*the [Allman style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style)
        is highly recommended.*) and copy-paste your code into the message panel
        and then press the "fixed font" and then the "send" buttons.
        (*Warning: unformatted code will probably be removed to trash!*)

4.  Be polite!

    >   If you think someone truly helped you, don't hesitate to say thank you,
        it is a nice and completely free gesture. (Joining the community is the
        best way to say thanks :))
        Also, try to avoid rude words and swearing. If you must have to use this
        kind of language, learn to use the chat's markdown, and post it as a
        striked through text.

    **Warning: inappropriate language won't be tolerated and the message
    would be removed to trash!**
