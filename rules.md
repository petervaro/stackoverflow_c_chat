The Order Of The C Chatroom
===========================

Rules
-----

0.  The purpose of this room is to help each other in learning, understanding and
    using the C programming language and all its related theories and
    technologies (compilers, preprocessors, build automation systems, UNIX,
    versioning, etc).

    > That doesn't mean we restrict ourselves to talk about C only. We are also
    > discussing our projects and sometimes even our problems in life as well
    > since we are building a real community here. But, the main topic still
    > remains C. Because other languages have their own chat-rooms, if you are
    > interested in those other languages' features, know-hows or any other
    > discussions about them, please join the designated rooms instead.

1.  Be nice!

    > This is a very friendly, open and helpful room. And we are working very
    > hard to keep it that way, and so should you. We are all here to help
    > each other, to start meaningful and constructive conversations and to
    > achieve the ultimate goal of this room. (*See the first rule!*)

2.  No trolling! (And no feeding!)

    > What is trolling? An endless and purposeless debate which is being
    > instigated again and again by the same debater, the troll.

3.  C stands for...

    > Code, Control, Community, Complexity, Creativity, Craziness... -- *you
    > get the idea* ;)



Guidelines
----------

Please read the [chatroom FAQ](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/faq) if you
haven't already!

0. Use our *chat-lang*, because it's fun!

    > We have a [tiny language](http://bit.ly/c_chat) we use to greet each
    > other, or to say 'good bye', or to indicate we are currently not available
    > or that we have returned. *And of course, it is C related ;)*

1. You don't have to ask to ask, just ask.

    > We are here to help, although it is not guaranteed that we can, however
    > we will definitely try to! (*See the first rule!*)

2. When asking, try to help us, so we can help you!

    > Have you ever heard of the concept of SSCCE (Short, Self Contained,
    > Compilable, Example)?
    > [If not, you definitely have to check it out!](http://sscce.org)

3. Ping, only if necessary!

    > Feel free to ping a member during the conversation, whenever it helps to
    > smoothen the discussion, but please don't overdo it though, as it can be
    > pretty annoying after a short period of time.

4. Format your code!

    > Try to follow one of the
    > [code-styling conventions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style)
    > (*the
    > [Allman style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style)
    > is highly recommended.*) and copy-paste your code into the message panel
    > and then press the "fixed font" and then the "send" buttons.
    > (*Warning: unformatted code will probably be removed to trash!*)

5. Be polite!

    > If you think someone truly helped you, don't hesitate to say thank you, it
    > is a nice and completely free gesture. (Joining the community is the best
    > way to say thanks :)) Also, try to avoid rude words and swearing. If you
    > must have to use this kind of language, learn to use the chat's markdown,
    > and post it as a striked through text.

    **Warning: inappropriate language won't be tolerated and the message would
    be removed to trash!**
